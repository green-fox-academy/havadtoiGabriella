Green is universally associated with nature, linked as it is to grass, plants and trees.
It also represents growth and renewal, being the color of spring and rebirth. 
Another association is “getting the green light” to go ahead, giving it an association 
with taking action. In the US, green (and especially dark green) is also associated with
money and so represents prosperity and stability.
